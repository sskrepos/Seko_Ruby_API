## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'seko'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install seko

## Usage
#### Configuration
config/initializers/seko.rb
```ruby
Seko.configure(
  token:                'SekoAPIToKeN'
  supplier_code:        'DEFSUPTCLTD001',
  supplier_description: 'Default Supplier TEST COMPANY LTD',
  supplier_uom:         1,
  warehouses: {
    us: 'US123',
    uk: 'UK123'
  }
)
```

#### Basics

In order to communicate with Seko(SupplyStream) you need to instantiate an instance of the `Seko::Client` class using the token configured in the configuration step above.

```ruby
client = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
```

#### Testing vs. Live Mode

In order to use the live endpoint and corresponding live account with Seko you should pass it in as an argument to the client since the default is test mode.

```ruby
client = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token], { test_mode: false })
```


#### Submit Product

```ruby
client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.submit_product(upc: "123456", description: 'A test product')
```

This will post product information to Supply Stream. However, your account representative will need to apply stock levels.

#### Send Return Request

```ruby
line_items = [ { upc: "123456", quantity: 10 } ]
warehouse  = Seko.config[:warehouses][:us]
client     = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response   = client.send_return_request(line_item_array, warehouse)
```

Once a return return request is submited, also know as an Advanced Shipment Notice(ASN), the warehouse will either send a push notification with a Goods Received Notice(GRN) or you can check the GRN status below by using the GUID generated by this request.

#### Submit Company

```ruby
company_hash = {
  code:        'IND001',
  description: 'Indigina'
}
client     = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response   = client.submit_company(company_hash)
```

Useful for submitting companies to place wholesale orders.

#### Get Stock

```ruby
client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.get_inventory
```

Getting inventory will return inventory for all Warehouses configured. Pass in the warehouse identifier to filter the results by warehouse.

#### Check GRN

```ruby
client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.check_grn('5b2dcd8e-52c3-4e27-a712-eaacda2dd8fe')
```

Check the status of a Return Request(ASN) submitted.

#### Order Status

```ruby
client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.order_status('5b2dcd8e-52c3-4e27-a712-eaacda2dd8fe')
```

Check the status of an order.

#### Order Tracking

```ruby
client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.order_tracking('5b2dcd8e-52c3-4e27-a712-eaacda2dd8fe')
```

Get the tracking information for a given order.

#### Cancel Order

```ruby
Seko::Order::CANCEL_CODES
# => {
#      "001" => "Customer Request", 
#      "002" => "Order Delayed", 
#      "003" => "Duplicate", 
#      "004" => "Item not available", 
#      "005" => "Cannot ship to address", 
#      "006" => "Other"
#    }

client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.cancel_order('5b2dcd8e-52c3-4e27-a712-eaacda2dd8fe', '001')
```

Cancels a placed order, only works if the order isn't already shipped.

#### Stock Movements

```ruby
client    = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
warehouse = Seko.config[:warehouses][:us]
from      = 3.days.ago
to        = Time.now
response  = client.stock_movements(from, to, warehouse)
```

#### Stock Adjustments

```ruby
client    = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
warehouse = Seko.config[:warehouses][:us]
from      = 3.days.ago
to        = Time.now
response  = client.stock_adjustments(from, to, warehouse)
```

#### Dispatch Statuses

```ruby
client    = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
warehouse = Seko.config[:warehouses][:us] # warehouse is optional
from      = 3.days.ago
to        = Time.now
response  = client.dispatch_statuses(from, to, warehouse)

# get collection of GUIDs dispatched
guid_array = Seko::Dispatch.parse(response)
# returns something like this
# => ["2b5e52cc-fb6f-4ea4-b8cf-cf64e3a2b8db", "93e92ca2-725a-46f8-90dd-43a16105f78d"]
```

#### Submit Order

```ruby
order = {
  shipping_address: {
    first_name: "John",
    last_name:  "Smith",
    address1:   "123 Here Now",
    address2:   "2nd Floor",
    city:       "New York",
    state:      "New York",
    country:    "US",
    zipcode:    "10012",
    phone:      "123-123-1234"
  },
  email:            "someone@somehwere.com",
  number:           "R123123123",
  warehouse:        "DC123",
  date:             "2013-12-12",
  shipping_carrier: "DLP",
  shipping_method:  "22",
  line_items: [
    {
      quantity: "1",
      sku:      "123332211"
    }
  ]
}

client   = Seko::Client.new(Seko.config[:token])
response = client.send_order_request(order)

### NOTE you may want to store the GUID from the response
### you need the guid for status updates, tracking, and canceling orders
response.guid

if response.success?
  # DO SOMETHING
else
  # QUEUE REQUEST, STORE AND RAISE ERRORS
end
```
